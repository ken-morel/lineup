# Line up

![screenshot](./SCREENSHOT.png)

Lineup is a linear regression graphical tool built with [gama](https://github.com/ken-morel/gama).

With lineup, you can easily and precisely plot points using the guides, edit
or delete the points and have an updating best fit line to visualize the
progression of the linear regression, with configurable learn_rate.

This is a gama project, thus is built in C(like gama), and is a standard
sublime text and codeblocks project, with configured build systems. Other
editors like helix may use `clangd` for lsp features and build the project
with gama cli standard commands.

## Contributing

This code may not be in the best state, I just ended up adding features
to make the ui nicer, but if you wish to contribute, a pr, or an issue
will be welcome.
